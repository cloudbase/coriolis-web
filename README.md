## Install instructions

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) is required
- clone repo
- run `npm install` or `npm install --omit=dev` to install packages and dependencies for development or production mode
- set `CORIOLIS_URL` environment variable

## Build instructions

- run `npm run build`
- run `npm run start` to start the server

Your server will be running at `http://localhost:3000/` (the port is configurable through `PORT` environment variable)

## Testing

- unit tests can be run using `npm run test`
- run `npm run test-release` to check for Typescript and ESLint errors, to run the unit tests and to build and start a production build.

## Development mode

- set env. variable `NODE_ENV='development'`
- run `npm run client-dev` to start local development server (starts on port 3001)
- run `npm run server-dev` to start the express server in development mode

To debug the client code using VS Code, simply run the project's launch configuration from the 'Run' menu (Ctrl+Shift+D).
The last 2 `npm run ...` commands must be running in the background.

To debug the Node server using VS Code, run `npm run server-debug` instead of `npm run server-dev`.

You can view some of the UIs components in the [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) by running `npm run storybook`

## Modding

The UI can be modded externally using a `.json` modding file. A sample is available in the repo [`ui-mod-sample.json`](ui-mod-sample.json).

The path to the .json mod file needs to be set in `MOD_JSON` environment variable (ex.: `MOD_JSON=/usr/ui-mod.json`).

Any provider logos can be replaced using local logo images. The local image file paths need to be absolute.

You can specify one logo, in which case it will be scaled to all sizes. You can also specify logos for just a couple of the sizes, in which case the closest size to the one required will be used. Open [`ui-mod-sample.json`](ui-mod-sample.json) for more details.

Any option from [`config.ts`](config.ts) can be modified by adding the `config` field to the [`ui-mod-sample.json`](ui-mod-sample.json) file.

## Environment variables

All environment variables can be set in a `.env` file created in the root directory.

The following is the list of environment variables and their default values:

```(bash)
NODE_ENV='production'
CORIOLIS_URL='<your-coriolis-url>'
MOD_JSON='<path-to-json>'
CA_FINGERPRINT='<path to CA fingerprint file used by metal hub agent>'
```
